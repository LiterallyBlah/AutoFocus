# AutoFocus

**AutoFocus** is a companion tool designed for use alongside [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon), focusing on automating initial data analysis for reconnaissance. AutoFocus processes files generated by AutoRecon, highlights version numbers, flags points of interest, and outputs findings in JSON format, allowing penetration testers to concentrate on actionable information with minimal manual review.

## Features
- **Automatic File Enumeration**: Recursively enumerates files within target directories created by AutoRecon, organised by IP address.
- **Chunked Data Processing**: Feeds manageable data chunks into a local language model for efficient analysis.
- **Task-Based Processing**: Utilises a configurable task file in YAML/JSON to define tasks, with each task targeting specific data points.
- **Structured JSON Output**: Outputs findings in JSON format, with tasks organised as keys and results as values.
- **Extendable and Customisable**: Adaptable for specific reconnaissance scenarios, with flexibility to add or modify tasks as required.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**: AutoFocus reads files generated by AutoRecon, organised by IP directory, and processes them recursively.
2. **Data Chunking**: Files are chunked to ensure manageable input for the language model, reducing processing load.
3. **Task Execution**: Each chunk is analysed according to a configurable list of tasks. The language model flags version numbers and points of interest, while tasks can be customised as needed.
4. **JSON Output**: After all tasks are executed, results are saved in JSON format, making it easy to review findings or integrate them into other tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- A local large language model (e.g., Qwen 2.5) to enable offline processing
- AutoRecon for gathering initial data

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiterallyBlah/AutoFocus.git
cd AutoFocus
```

Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. Ensure AutoRecon has generated the necessary directories for each target IP.
2. Run AutoFocus:
   ```bash
   python autofcus.py --input /path/to/autorecon/output --output /path/to/output.json
   ```
3. Configure tasks by editing `tasks.yaml` (or `tasks.json`), defining each taskâ€™s name, description, and output structure.

## Task Configuration
Tasks are specified in a YAML or JSON file, with each task requiring:
- `name`: A unique identifier for the task.
- `description`: A brief description of what the task checks for.
- `output`: The structure of the result in the final JSON output.

Example (`tasks.yaml`):
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: "version_check"
    description: "Identify software version numbers for correlation with known issues"
    output: "version_numbers"
  - name: "points_of_interest"
    description: "Highlight unusual or potentially risky configurations"
    output: "poi"
```
